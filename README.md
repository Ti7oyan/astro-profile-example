# Astro profile card example

This is a simple demo of a profile card made with Astro.

You can customize it as you like by editing the `src/profile.tsx` file. For styling, edit the `src/ProfileCard.astro` file.

Run it with `npm run dev`, build it with `npm run build`.

**ON LINUX**: for deployment change the target repository in `./deploy.sh` for your repository and then use `chmod +x ./deploy.sh` and `npm run deploy`.
